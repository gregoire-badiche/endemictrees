                    <p>Welcome to Endemic Trees, a project dedicated to protecting our planet by planting the right trees, in
                        the right places. We work with students and schools across France to raise awareness about
                        deforestation, the loss of biodiversity, and the importance of planting endemic species—trees that
                        naturally grow in our regions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why does it matter? Because when we plant trees that belong to our ecosystem, we help bees, birds,
                        insects, and the soil stay healthy. When we plant trees that don’t, we may harm more than we help.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Join us in creating forests that last—not just trees, but <strong>whole ecosystems.</strong></p>
